# BCNF, or Boyce-Codd Normal Form

BCNF, or Boyce-Codd Normal Form, is a design principle used in database normalization to eliminate redundancy and dependency anomalies. At the gate level, we don't typically deal with databases directly, but I can explain BCNF in a more intuitive, conceptual way, focusing on how it might relate to logical circuits.
