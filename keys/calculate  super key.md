# Determine the total number of superkeys

When a relation has more than one candidate key, you can still determine the total number of superkeys, but the process involves understanding the relationships among the candidate keys

## Total Superkeys Calculation

To calculate the total number of superkeys:

For each candidate key

`𝐾𝑖: `

Superkeys from 𝐾𝑖 = 2(𝑛−𝑎𝑖) Superkeys from Ki =2 (n−ai )

Where `𝑎𝑖` is the number of attributes in candidate key `𝐾𝑖`.

The total number of superkeys is the sum of superkeys derived from each candidate key, adjusted for overlaps if necessary.
