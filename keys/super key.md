# A super key in a Database Management System (DBMS)

A super key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of one or more attributes (columns) that can uniquely identify a record (`row`) in a table. 

A `super key` may contain additional attributes that are not necessary for unique identification, meaning it can be larger than the minimum required to maintain uniqueness.

**Specification:**

- super key can be any combination of attributes that uniquely identifies records in a table. 

- However, a candidate key is a `minimal super key`, meaning it contains no `unnecessary` attributes.

- The `primary key` is the chosen candidate key that uniquely identifies records in a table.
