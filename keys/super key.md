# A super key in a Database Management System (DBMS)

A super key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of one or more attributes (columns) that can uniquely identify a record (`row`) in a table. 

A `super key` may contain additional attributes that are not necessary for unique identification, meaning it can be larger than the minimum required to maintain uniqueness.
